                <h2>Being an exchange student in Italy. Enjoy your time!</h2>
                

				If you have a chance to be an exchange student, enjoy it as much as you can!
								This post shares my story during my time in Pisa, Italy. I know, leaning tower! To be honest, I didn't enjoy that much
							during my time there, which I regreted a lot. Anyway, let's see what I can offer here </p>
							<p>
								<ol>
									<li> Some note before your move, packaging, housing, "permesso di soggiorno" </li>
									<li> Where to travel in Italy? What to do? </li>
									<li> How to network as an exchange student? You almost know no one, right? </li>
									<li> If you are a hard-working student, how to balance? </li>
								</ol>
