                <h2>SEARCH YEAR VISA IN THE NETHERLANDS</h2>
                

                  In this topic, I will share about the Search Year Visa (Zoekjaar Visa) for graduates to look for jobs after their graduation. This is all based on my experience and aims to share information that I wished I knew before I started my journey under this Visa. So, what you can find here?

                    <p><b>What is Search Year Visa, and how to apply for it?</b></p>

                    <p><b>Timeline for the application process: my application</b></p>
               
                <p>I applied in end-2021 from abroad (Those apply in the Netherlands will do a little bit different). Here’s my timeline:</p>
				<li> 01 November 2021: Called the local embassy to book appoitment to apply for zoekjaar visa</li>
				<li> 29 November 2021: My appointment with the embassy. I came there to get my fingerprint collected. 
					I received a letter from the embassy with my v-number, came home and sent my scanned documents to the address stated in the letter.
				</li>
				<li> 29 February 2022: Got my approval. IND informed that the process could take up to 3 months but due to backlogs, it could be even longer</li>
				<li> March 2022: I came back to the embassy to give my passport, left it there and asked the embassy to send it
					by post to my home once I got the visa sticker
				</li>
				<li> 08 April 2022: I flew to the Netherlands. A new journey started.
				</li>
                
                <p></p>
                     <p><b>What should you prepare before your departure to the Netherlands?</b></p>
