                <h2>The People Behind the Work – A Journey of Gratitude</h2>
                

				<p>Work is often measured by tasks completed, goals achieved, and projects delivered. 
					But when I look back, it’s never just about the work itself—it’s about the people. 
					The ones who made each day meaningful, the conversations that sparked new ideas, the unexpected friendships, and the small moments that turned colleagues into lifelong connections.</p>
                
                 
                <p>This isn’t just a reflection on one workplace but a growing story of everyone I’ve had the privilege to work with. 
					From my first job to my current role and wherever the future takes me, the people I meet along the way will always be at the heart of my journey. 
					With this note, I want to express my gratitude to everyone I’ve had—or will have—the chance to work with. 
					Thank you for being part of my journey.</p>
				<p><b>My Team – Where Everything Begins</b></p>
				<p>From my first day, my team has been a huge part of my journey. I remember our lunch walks with <strong>Rik</strong>, <strong>Yohans</strong>, <strong>Kasim</strong>, and <strong>Amber</strong>—how you all had to slow down just so I could keep up, just because I am the shortest in the group. 
					Those walks were more than just a break; they were a time to share thoughts, exchange ideas, and simply enjoy each other’s company. 
					Then when our team joining IT, this brought new opportunities to connect.
					 I still remember our team event playing golf, where I ended up in the same group as <strong>Michiel</strong>. 
					 I didn’t know at the time that he was quite good at it, and to this day, I still wonder if he’s a frequent player. 
			

				<p>I’ll always appreciate the calm presence of <strong>Marcel</strong> and <strong>Arno</strong>—no matter what was happening in the office, they always had a relaxed presence that somehow made everything feel okay. 
					You both also gave me some great advice about freelancing, something I still think about from time to time. 
					Then there is <strong>Furkan</strong>, the IT lifesaver—always there to help with everything.
					 And of course, <strong>Jan Ijden</strong>, who truly cared about his people. At both of our team events, we coincidentally ended up in the same group. 
					 Every time, I heard the same voice from him: <em>"Listen to your people."</em> That’s something I’ll carry with me in my career.</p>
					 <p>I also had the chance to go on a business trip to my home country, which ended up being a great experience. 
						During that trip, I realized just how approachable <strong>Maurice</strong> is. 
						He isn't the typical serious, no-smile director. 
						In fact, I’ll never forget the moment when he told me he'd had three Pho for breakfast (which is not normal for locals). 
						In that moment I realized how human he truly was and that he could joke and connect with us on a personal level. 
						He made it clear that being a director doesn’t mean being distant, and that was an important lesson I’ll take with me.</p>

					 <p>Then <strong>Miranda</strong>, who I got to know better during that trip as well. 
						There’s something about traveling together that lets you see a different side of a person, 
						and through those shared experiences, something deeper formed. 
						I will always appreciate how she would offer to talk whenever she saw me in a bit of a down mood. 
						Her kindness and willingness to listen went beyond just being a co-worker—it truly showed that she cared, and that’s something I will always value.</p>
					 
					 <p>And then there’s <strong>Dede</strong>. She made the daily commute something I actually looked forward to. 
						Our trips together were never just about getting from work to home; 
						they were times for us to connect, share stories, and genuinely enjoy each other's company. 
						What really made her stand out to me was how much she cared, not just as a colleague. 
						Whether it was sharing laughter or having those moments of support when things felt tough, Dede always went beyond the typical coworker role. 
						She was there for me in ways that I won’t forget (and yay, we live in the same city, I will concern about her if I ever plan to move out.)</p>
