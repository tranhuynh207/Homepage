			<h2>Gratitude in Every Step: The People Who Shaped My Journey</h2>

			<p>Work is often measured by tasks completed, goals achieved, and projects delivered. But when I think about my journey here, it’s never just about the work itself—it’s about the people. The ones who make each day meaningful, the conversations that spark new ideas, the unexpected friendships, and the small moments that turn colleagues into lifelong connections.</p>
			
			<p>This isn't just a reflection on one workplace but a growing story of everyone I have the privilege to work with. From my first job to my current role, and wherever the future takes me, the people I meet along the way will always be at the heart of my journey. With this note, I want to express my gratitude to everyone I’ve had—or will have—the chance to work with. Thank you for being part of my journey.</p>
			
			<p><b>My Team – Where Everything Begins</b></p>
			<p>From my first day, my team has been a huge part of my journey. I remember our lunch walks with <strong>Rik</strong>, <strong>Yohans</strong>, <strong>Kasim</strong>, and <strong>Amber</strong>—how you all slow down just so I can keep up, just because I’m the shortest in the group. Those walks are more than just a break; they’re a time to share thoughts, exchange ideas, and simply enjoy each other’s company. And <strong>Amber</strong>, again, our bug finders journey with Kyos will always stay in mind (haha). </p>
			
			<p>I’ll always appreciate the calm presence of <strong>Marcel</strong> and <strong>Arno</strong>—no matter what happens in the office, you both bring a relaxed energy that somehow makes everything feel manageable. You both also gave me great advice about freelancing, which I still think about from time to time. And then there is <strong>Michiel <\strong>, I still remember our team event playing golf, where I ended up in the same group as him. I didn’t know at the time that he was quite good at it, and to this day, I still wonder if he’s a frequent player. 
			
			<p>I also have the chance to go on a business trip to my home country, which ends up being a fantastic experience. During that trip, I realize just how approachable <strong>Maurice</strong> is. He’s not the typical serious, no-smile director. In fact, I’ll never forget the moment when he texted me saying he had three Pho for breakfast (which is a bit unusual for locals but it means he truly likes our foods). In that moment, I realized how human he truly is and that he can joke and connect with us on a personal level. He makes it clear that being a director doesn’t mean being distant, and that’s an important lesson I’ll take with me.</p>
			
			<p>Then there’s <strong>Miranda</strong>, who I got to know better during that trip. There’s something about traveling together that lets you see a different side of a person, and through those shared experiences, something deeper forms. I will always appreciate how she offers to talk whenever she sees me in a bit of a down mood. Her kindness and willingness to listen go beyond just being a co-worker—it shows that she truly cares, and that’s something I will always value.</p>
			
			<p>And then there’s <strong>Dede</strong>. She makes the daily commute something I actually look forward to. Our trips together are never just about getting from work to home; they’re times for us to connect, share stories, and genuinely enjoy each other’s company. What really makes her stand out to me is how much she cares, not just as a colleague. Whether it’s sharing laughter or offering support when things feel tough, Dede always goes beyond the typical coworker role. She’s there for me in ways I won’t forget</p>
			
			<p><b>Connections Beyond The Team</b></p>
			
			<p>Beyond my direct team, there were many colleagues who shaped my experience in different ways. <strong>Staszek</strong> once shared his story about living in Argentina, and I couldn’t help but feel a bit envious. Living in South America has always been in the back of my mind, and our conversation made me wonder if I’d ever have the chance to do like he did.</p>
			
			<p>Then there’s <strong>Leander</strong>, who always patiently explained his requests to me. Through those conversations, I gained a deeper understanding of the finance field. But beyond professional advice, he also offered life advice. One of his key pieces of advice was, "<em>Don’t be scared of anything</em>." I know for sure that this will stay with me for a lifetime. I’m sure anyone would be lucky to have him as a mentor.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Arjan</strong>, I’ll never forget the time he had to kneel down just to talk to me because of our height difference (haha). Those little moments made work feel more fun.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Rico</strong> once shared with me a piece of advice that really stuck: he said that work is invaluable, it can be free at first (just to build trust), and then charge later rather than offering it at a low cost. That mindset has really shifted how I think about the value of my own work and what it means to build relationships.</p>
			
			<p>And while I could go on and list every incredible person—<strong>Rianne</strong>, <strong>Ton</strong>, <strong>Natusha</strong>, <strong>Marleen</strong>, and so many others—the list would just keep growing. Of course, I will keep adding to it when I have more time, because for me, every person and every interaction with them is truly unique. These connections are irreplaceable and can never be repeated.</p>

			<p>Years from now, when I look back, I know I’ll smile and think of all of you as if it were just yesterday—those small moments, the wisdom shared, the laughter, the challenges overcome, and the lessons learned. It’s all part of what has made this journey so special. So, I document it now, not just for today but as a reminder that every person I've worked with has left a lasting impact, one that I'll carry with me wherever I go.</p>
