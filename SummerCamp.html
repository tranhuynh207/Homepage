                <h2>My volunteer kick-off: Summer camp!</h2>
                

				<p>Years ago, I volunteered at the Pacific Links Foundation’s summer camp, thinking I’d be the one teaching the kids. 
				The goal was simple: help them understand human trafficking, raise awareness, give them tools to stay safe. 
				I thought I had it all figured out.</p>
                
                 
                <p>But as soon as I set foot on the campgrounds, something changed. 
				It was the way the kids looked at me—curious, eager, but also guarded. 
				It wasn’t just about teaching them; I realized pretty quickly that something bigger was happening here. 
				Something that had nothing to do with facts and figures. 
				The theme of the camp was “Connecting Future” and at first, I thought, “Sure, I get it. 
				We’re here to guide them, help them feel empowered.”</p>
				<p>What I didn’t know was that I would need that reminder myself.</p>
                
                <p>By the second day, I was starting to see it. These kids, some barely 15, were brimming with energy. 
					But there was something else beneath the surface—a hunger for something deeper. 
					It wasn’t just about playing games or getting through the day. They were looking for meaning.</p>

                <p> And that’s when I met her. She was about to start university, full of ambition. 
					She wanted to be a lawyer, to fight for people who’ve been hurt. But she was terrified.</p>

			   <p>“I’m not sure I’m good enough,” she said, her voice low. 
			   “Everyone around me wants to be doctors or engineers. 
			   They’re aiming for these big careers, and I just want to help people… I don’t know if that’s enough.”</p>       
               
			   <p>It’s hard to explain what it felt like to sit across from her in that moment. 
				Here she was, full of ambition, yet questioning her worth. 
				I didn’t have a magic answer, but I could see her strength, even if she couldn’t yet see it herself. I just listened.</p>

				<p>After a pause, I gently said, "The world needs people like you—people who are brave enough to stand up for others, to fight for justice. 
					Your dream is important. It matters."</p>
				
				<p>In that instant, I saw the doubt in her eyes start to shift, just a little. 
					It was like a small crack in a wall she had built around herself. I felt it too—a flicker of hope. 
					And that, I realized, was the most important thing I could give her—not answers, but belief in her own strength.
				</p>
				<p>I smiled, and I think she did too.</p>

				<p>A few days later, after the activities were over, I found myself sitting with a small group of girls around a campfire. 
					They were sharing their dreams—their hopes for the future. 
					One girl spoke up about wanting to become a teacher, but her voice wavered.</p>
				
				<p>“I don’t know… it doesn’t seem like a big dream,” she said. 
					“My friends want to be doctors or lawyers, and I just want to teach. I’m scared it’s not enough.”</p>
				
					<p>I leaned forward, feeling her vulnerability. 
						“The world needs teachers just as much as it needs doctors or lawyers.
						Your dream is important,” I said, trying to make her see it. 
						And just like that, the tension in her shoulders seemed to melt. 
						It was a small shift, but I could see her start to believe it.</p>

				<p>I kept thinking about the camp’s theme: “Connecting Future” 
					It wasn’t just a phrase. It was a promise. We weren’t here just to warn them about trafficking. 
					We were here to show them a future they could believe in. 
					And somehow, as much as I was teaching them, they were teaching me, too.</p>

				<p>By the time the camp ended, I was drained—physically, mentally, emotionally. 
					But it was the best kind of exhaustion. The kind that comes from knowing you’ve been a part of something bigger than yourself.</p>

				<p>As I walked away from the camp that day, I looked up at the backdrop with the words “Summer Camp: Connecting Future” written across it. 
					For the first time, I really understood what it meant. 
					It wasn’t just about giving these kids the information they needed to stay safe—it was about showing them they had the power to shape their own futures. 
					That their dreams, no matter how big or small, were worth fighting for.</p>
				
				<p> It was about <b>hope</b>. 
					About helping them believe that they weren’t defined by their past. They were defined by the dreams they chose to chase.</p>

				<p>I didn’t just teach them that week. They taught me, too. 
					They taught me that no matter where you come from, no matter how old you are, you always have the power to believe in your future.</p>
				
				<p>I’ll carry that with me, always.</p>
